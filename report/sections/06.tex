\section{Question 6}

The open-loop transfer function is equal to the product of the transfer function
of the controller $F(s)$ and that of the process $G(s)$. The crossover frequency
$\omega_c$ is the frequency at which the magnitute of $F(j\omega)G(j\omega)$ is
$1.0$.

In practice, we were able to derive the crossover frequency by using MATLAB's
\texttt{margin()} function, with argument the open-loop transfer function.

Table \ref{tbl:Q6} illustrates the crossover frequencies in rad/s for set values
of the $\chi$, $\zeta$ and $\omega_0$ parameters.
