\section{Question 10}

The highest sampling rate that results in the step response satisfying the
control requirements was found to be $T_s = 0.5$ sec. This value lies within
all intervals proposed by the empirical rules considered in the previous question.

The difference in performance can be accounted for by the discretization of the
PID parameters, since they are approximated.

Figure \ref{fig:Q10.response} illustrates the step response for $T_s = 0.5$ and
table \ref{tbl:Q10.requirements} shows the resulting control performance.
