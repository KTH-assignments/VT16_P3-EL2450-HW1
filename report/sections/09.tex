\section{Question 9}

In theory\cite{levine}, as a general rule of thumb, the sampling period should
be selected so that $$0.08 < T_s \omega_c < 0.3$$ where $\omega_c$ is the
crossover frequency of the open-loop system, hence with $\omega_c = 0.3619$
rad/s $$0.220 < T_s < 0.829\ sec$$

A second way one could look at this is to choose a sampling time such that there
are $4$ to $10$ samples per rise time $T_r$. In this case where $T_r=4.95$ sec,
the resulting range of acceptable values for the sampling time is
$$0.495 < T_s < 1.2375\ sec$$

Another way one could look at this is to select a sampling frequency that is
much higher than twice the bandwidth of the closed-loop system. Given our
setting, the bandwidth $\omega_0 = 0.5819$ rad/s and
$$10\omega_0 < \omega_s < 30\omega_0$$
$$0.36 < T_s < 1.08\ sec$$
