\section{Question 17}

Figure \ref{fig:Q17.response} illustrates the step responses for the discrete
system and the system with a discretized controller and a continuous process
for a sampling time of $T_s = 4$ sec.

The performance of the discrete controller - discrete plant is far better than
that of the discretized controller - continuous plant. This is due to the fact
that the designed controller is not a PID controller and that it is designed in
a way such that the discrete closed-loop system has exactly the same poles as
the continuous closed-loop system.
